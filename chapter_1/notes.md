- On Linux systems and OS X, the character to input to cause an EOF is Ctrl-D. For Windows, it's Ctrl-Z.
- The getchar() function is used to read individual characters from standard input and returns the special value EOF when the end-of-file is reached. The end of file may or may not be indicated by the Control-Z character, but in no case will the EOF value be the same as  the ASCII code for Control-Z. In fact, getchar() returns an int, not  a char, and itâ€™s important that its return value is stored in an int, as a comparison between a char and a signed integer is not guaranteed to work correctly.
